# Plotly - Graph Instructions

## Description
**[Plotly](https://plotly.com/)** is an extraordinary **'Visualization'** tool that can be used to create **highly informative** and **beautiful charts**.<br>

The repository contains a jupyter notebook,  [plotly-graph-instructions.ipynb](https://github.com/sagar-0817/plotly-graph-instructions/blob/master/plotly-graph-instructions.ipynb)
which contains the **instructions** to **interact** with the different **Plotly Graphs**.<br>

## Note
* Since plotly graphs are interactive and Github performs a static render of the notebook, the graphs do not appear when the notebook is viewed on GitHub.<br>
* You will be able to view the graphs when the notebook is rendered on [jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). All you have to do is go to the link,
copy and paste the following URL and click `Go!`.

* You can also view the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) where you can run the notebook and make changes if you want without downloading
the notebook to your local system.
